            <h2>Can't Hurt Me</h2>
            <p>
                Most people operate at only 40% of their capability. The human mind is powerful, 
                but it will always take the path of least resistance unless you force it to go beyond 
                its comfort zone. The only way to truly test yourself is to step into the fire, 
                endure the struggle, and come out on the other side, transformed. 
                <br><br>
                Stop making excuses, stop feeling sorry for yourself, and start realizing that 
                you are capable of so much more than you believe. The only thing standing between 
                you and your goals is the weak voice in your head that tells you to quit.
